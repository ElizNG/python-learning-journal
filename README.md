This is a repository to document my Python learning journey.

## About Me
My name is Elizabeth and I'm very excited to learn more about Python! I graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology. As you can see, I don't have a huge background in computer science or anything tech related, but this won't deter me from learning as much as I can and finding a career within the tech field.
## Goals for my Advanced Python course
* To further my Python skills and become more comfortable with the language.
* Learn as many interesting things about Python as I can.
* Have fun.
## My First Python Program
```python
message = "Hello World!"
print("How many", message, "messages do you think have been created?")
```
